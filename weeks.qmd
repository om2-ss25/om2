# Week 1

## Python Setup with uv

Welcome to this guide on setting up your Python development environment using the powerful package manager called `uv`. 

A properly configured development environment is crucial for efficient coding. It helps manage dependencies, keeps your projects organized, and provides powerful tools that make coding easier and more enjoyable. The `uv` package manager we'll be using is a modern, fast alternative to traditional Python package managers.

### Step 1: Apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack 🎓

The GitHub Student Developer Pack provides students with free access to the best developer tools.

1. Visit [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack?)  
2. Click on "Get your pack"  
3. Sign in with your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have it)
4. Verify your student status using your school-issued email
5. Complete the application form
6. Wait for approval (usually takes 1-7 days)

**Why this matters:** The pack includes free access to GitHub Copilot, which is an AI pair programmer that will help you write better code faster.

### Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code 💻

VS Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor.

:::{.callout-note title="Pro Tip for Microsoft" collapse="true"}
During installation on Windows, check the options "Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer file context menu" and "Add 'Open with Code' action to Windows Explorer directory context menu" for easier access.
:::


1. Go to [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download the appropriate version for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
4. Launch VS Code after installation


:::{.callout-note title="Pro Tip for Mac" collapse="true"}
To be able to open VS Code from the command line interface using `code .` command:

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette
3. Type "shell command" and select "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
4. Restart your terminal for changes to take effect
:::

### Step 3: Install Essential VS Code Extensions 🧩

Extensions enhance VS Code with additional features. We'll install three key extensions.

In VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press: Windows `Ctrl+Shift+X` / mac: `Cmd+Shift+X`).

**Python Extension**  

1. Search for "Python"
2. Find the extension by Microsoft (usually the first result)
3. Click "Install"

**GitHub Copilot**  

1. Search for "GitHub Copilot" in the Extensions marketplace
2. Click "Install"
3. After installation, sign in with your GitHub account using the account icon in the lower left sidebar
4. You'll be prompted to authorize VS Code to use GitHub Copilot

**GitHub Copilot Chat**  

1. Search for "GitHub Copilot Chat" in the Extensions marketplace
2. Click "Install"
3. This extension works alongside GitHub Copilot to provide conversational AI assistance


:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Note:** GitHub Copilot requires a subscription, but it's free with the GitHub Student Developer Pack you applied for in Step 1.
:::


You can enhance Copilot's chat responses by providing it with contextual details about your workflow, tools, or project specifics. Instead of manually including this context in every chat query, you can create a custom instructions file that automatically incorporates this information with every chat request.

- [Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization)

### Step 4: Install uv Package Manager ⚡

`uv` is a fast, modern Python package manager and resolver.

**For Windows (PowerShell):**  

1. Open PowerShell
2. Run the following command:  

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
3. Restart your PowerShell session to ensure `uv` is in your PATH

**For macOS/Linux (Terminal):**

1. Open Terminal
2. Run the following command:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If your system doesn't have curl, you can use wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Close and reopen your terminal to ensure `uv` is in your PATH

**Verify installation:** Type `uv --version` in your command line interface. You should see the version number of `uv` displayed.

### Step 5: Initialize Your First Project 

Now let's create a new Python project structure using `uv`:

1. Open your command line interface (PowerShell on Windows or Terminal on Mac/Linux)
2. Simply type the following command directly in your command line or first navigate to the directory where you want to create your project (e.g., `cd Documents`)
3. Run the following command to initialize a new project named "genai-app" with Python 3.11:

```bash
uv init genai-app --python 3.11
```

:::{.callout-tip title="What this does" collapse="true"}
- Creates a new directory called `genai-app`
- Sets up a project structure with Python 3.11
- Creates initial configuration files
:::




### Step 6: Navigate to Your Project Directory 📁

Let's move into your newly created project directory:

```bash
cd genai-app
```

**Check the directory contents:** You can use `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (macOS/Linux) to see what files were created.

### Step 7: Activate your Virtual Python Environment 🔄

A virtual environment is an isolated space where you can install packages without affecting your global Python installation. We can create and activate this environment with:


:::{.callout-warning title="Important"}
After using `uv sync`, you should not move your genai-app folder to a different location. Doing so may break path references and prevent your environment from working properly.
:::


```bash
uv sync
```

:::{.callout-tip title="What this does" collapse="true"}
- Creates a virtual environment for your project
- Sets up the environment based on your project's specifications
- This environment is isolated from your system Python installation
:::

If you encounter a "Permission Denied" error, use the command with `sudo` to use administrative privileges:

```bash
sudo uv sync
```


### Step 8: Install Required Packages 📦

Let's add some commonly used packages for AI and data science projects:

```bash
uv add pandas python-dotenv openai gradio streamlit
```

:::{.callout-tip title="What these packages do" collapse="true"}
- `pandas`: A beginner-friendly library that helps you work with data tables (like Excel spreadsheets)
- `python-dotenv`: Helps keep your passwords and API keys safe by storing them in a separate file
- `openai`: Connects your code to AI services like ChatGPT
- `gradio`: Creates simple web interfaces for your AI projects with minimal coding
- `streamlit`: Turns your Python scripts into interactive web apps with just a few lines of code
:::

### Step 9: Open your project in VS Code

Now let's open your new project in VS Code where we'll write our code:

1. Open VS Code 
2. Click on "File" in the top menu on the left
3. Select "Open Folder..."
4. Find and select your `genai-app` folder


:::{.callout-note title="Pro Tip" collapse="true"}

When you're in your command line, this command opens VS Code in your current directory (the `.` represents "current location").

```bash
code .
```

:::


### Step 10:Activate Your Virtual Environment ✅

Use your command line to activate your Virtual Environment in your genai-app folder:

- **On Windows:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

- **On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

:::{.callout-note title="Permission Denied" collapse="true"}
If you encounter a "Permission Denied" error, use the commands with `sudo` to use administrative privileges:

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\Activate
  ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  sudo source .venv/bin/activate
  ```
:::

### Step 11: Run Your First Python Program 🏃‍♀️

Let's make sure everything is working by running the example file. In your command line, type:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You should see a "Hello, world!" message appear. This confirms that:
1. Your Python is working correctly
2. Your virtual environment is active
3. You're ready to start coding!


### Troubleshooting Common Issues 🔧

**Package Installation Problems**  
If you see errors when adding packages:

1. Check that you're connected to the internet
2. Try running `uv sync` again to refresh your environment
3. Read the error message carefully - it often tells you exactly what went wrong

**"Command Not Found" Error**  
If your computer can't find the `uv` command:

1. Close your terminal completely and open a new one
2. If that doesn't work, you might need to add uv to your PATH (the list of places your computer looks for programs)
3. As a last resort, try reinstalling using the commands from Step 4

**VS Code Extensions Not Working**  
If the extensions we installed aren't behaving correctly:

1. Make sure you've signed in to your GitHub account in VS Code
2. Try updating VS Code to the latest version
3. You can reinstall extensions by uninstalling them first, then installing again

**"Permission Denied" error**  

If you encounter a "Permission Denied" error in your command line, it's typically a file system permissions issue. Your user account lacks sufficient permissions to write to the directory where operations are being attempted.

- Windows: Click on the provided hyperlik in the error message and follow the instructions. 
- Mac: To modify permissions for a directory (e.g., "genai-app") in your current working directory:

```bash
chmod 755 ./genai-app
```
Permission Values: 

- `755`: Owner can read/write/execute; others can read/execute  
- `700`: Only owner can read/write/execute  
- `777`: Everyone can read/write/execute (use with caution)  



### Conclusion 🎯

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Python development environment using `uv`. This modern setup will serve you well as you progress in your programming journey. Remember that learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint – take your time to understand each concept thoroughly.

Happy coding! 💻✨

## Installation of packages

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Open your command line (Terminal or PowerShell)
2. Navigate to your `genai-app` folder
3. Add the necessary packages:

```bash
uv add pandas python-dotenv openai gradio streamlit
```

## Download .env file

- Download the `.env` file from Moodle
- Unzip the file and move it into your genai-app project folder
- Make sure to add the .env file to your .gitignore file to prevent accidentally sharing sensitive environment variables when pushing to a repository ([what is a .gitignore file?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/ignoring-files)).

> 💡 **Mac users:** The `.env` file is hidden by default. Use the shortcut  
> `Cmd + Shift + .` in Finder to show hidden files.


## Create marketing app

Next, we'll build an AI-powered marketing app with gradio and the OpenAI-API:

- Open genai-app as a Folder in VS Code.  
- To generate the code, use GitHub Copilot Edits:
  - Mac: Press cmd+Shift+i
  - Windows: Press ctrl+Shift+i

Next, enter this prompt in the GitHub Copilot Edits window:

```markdown
Create an AI powered Python Instagram content generator.

Tech stack:
- Gradio UI
- OpenAI API
- python-dotenv

Requirements:
1. Load OPENAI_API_KEY from .env
2. Use client.chat.completions.create() API format
3. Name the gradio file app.py
4. Gradio interface with:
   - Content type selector (carousel/post/reel/story)
   - Target group selection
   - Topic input field
   - Output area for generated content
```



## Run marketing app

1. Open Powershell or Terminal and change into your genai-app directory. Activate Your Virtual Environment in your genai-app folder:

**On Windows:**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

**On Windows:**

```bash
sudo .venv\Scripts\Activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
sudo source .venv/bin/activate
```

**How to solve this issue permanently:** If you encounter a "Permission Denied" error in your command line, it's typically a file system permissions issue. Your user account lacks sufficient permissions to write to the directory where operations are being attempted.

**Windows**: Click on the provided hyperlik in the error message and follow the instructions. 

**Mac**: To modify permissions for a directory (e.g., "genai-app") in your current working directory:

```bash
chmod 755 ./genai-app
```

**Permission Values:**

- `755`: Owner can read/write/execute; others can read/execute
- `700`: Only owner can read/write/execute
- `777`: Everyone can read/write/execute (use with caution)
